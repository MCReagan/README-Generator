# Custom SVG Logo Maker
     

## Description


This project was started to create an application that can quickly create a simple svg logo with user-defined text and colors. It accomplishes this task by allowing the flow of information across multiple javascript files. This code uses Javascript, npm for testing, inquirer for user prompts, fs for writing the SVG file, and isCss3Color node module to check for user color inputs. For myself, the most difficult aspect of creating this application was the process of organizing the flow of information through the js files.
